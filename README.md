# geometric_control

Coding of the tools derived in geometric control theory.

There are two main scripts:
- geometric_JFM.m: It applies the averaging analysis of geometric control theory to the model that we published in JFM. Refer to: Taha, H., Pla Olea, L., Khalifa, N., Gonzalez, C., & Rezaei, A. (2021). Geometric-control formulation and averaging analysis of the unsteady aerodynamics of a wing with oscillatory controls. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 928, A30. doi:10.1017/jfm.2021.826
- geometric_BL.m: It applies the averaging analysis of geometric control theory to the Beddoes-Leishman model of dynamic stall.
